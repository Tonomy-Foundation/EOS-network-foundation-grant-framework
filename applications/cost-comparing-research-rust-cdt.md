## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Research for building Rust Antelope CDT
- **Brief Description:** Checking the most cost-effective plan among the cases we thought of is mandatory for building Rust Antelope CDT.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** Many developers using other languages besides C++ will be able to join the Antelope ecosystem and become its builders. We set the first target to Rust.
- **Reason for Interest:** Lack of language support despite the extremely fast processing speed leaves something to be desired, and we anticipate that modern language support & language diversity help improve this point and expand builder pool. Additionally, in terms of our interests, we would like to contribute to technology-focused areas.


### Project Details

The project will investigate the following two parts in order to verify the suitable direction to implement:

1. Sufficient compatibility between EOS VM and wasm binary from [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)-based compiler
    - Rust `antelope.cdt` API implementation
1. Lack of compatibility between EOS VM and wasm binary from [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)-based compiler exists
    - Developing compiler first -> Rust `antelope.cdt` API implementation
    - Or Wasmer VM integration on Antelope

This research has been written as a separated proposal since the follow-up plan will be quite different by the result.

### Ecosystem Fit

This implementation allows Antelope to extend one more contract language, Rust, and this would be the cornerstone of the multiple language support in the Antelope ecosystem. As WASM can be built with Golang and Javascript recently, we look forward Antelope to embracing more other languages' users.

```

NOTE: There is no official general Rust LLVM. This standardization project is still in incubation status.

Assumptions: For cost-effective building, we want to build from the many works of Wasmer, although Antelope doesn't need to mount Wamser.

#### Cases

1. If `IR ≅ IR'` and `API ≅ API'`
    - We can directly start from Wasmer's implementation
        - Implement Antelope-specific data structure and API of `eosio.cdt` (Like table, vector, etc.)
1. Else if `IR ≅ IR'` and `API != API'`
    - Implement a compiler, which works for adjusting WASM API interface from Wasmer spec to EOSVM spec
    - After then, start (1)
1. Else (`IR != IR'` and `API != API'`)
    - Mount Wasmer on Antelope would be the cheapest
    - Mount Wasmer, make compatible with the existing state DB, and work on (1)
    - [Draft proposal of this case](https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS/grant-framework/blob/docs/wasmer-integration/applications/wasmer-integration.md)

### Why Wasmer?

Performance of Wasmer is placed in the top tier. See [benchmark 2021](https://00f.net/2021/02/22/webassembly-runtimes-benchmarks/). Also, it has the biggest ecosystem among WASM VM and supports many languages accordingly.
